# LLMs-Cheatsheet

This repo aims to be a comprehensive resource for those interested in Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on running and fine-tuning small models on personal hardware. Our goal is to empower users to work with powerful, locally-run LLMs that are tailored to their needs, ensuring data privacy and maintaining digital sovereignty. By avoiding reliance on third-party providers, you retain full control over your models and information, free from the risk of sudden access restrictions or policy changes.
